# Reddit API & whodatedwho.com Web Scraping

Practiced using APIs by collecting data from popular reddit pages and calculated the average title lengths for each. 

Also experimented with the Beautiful Soup library to scrape the relationship data from the people listed in the config.json file. Uses caching of downloaded HTML pages to avoid making an excessive number of requests to the website.
